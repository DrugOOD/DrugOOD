## DrugOOD: OOD Dataset Curator and Benchmark for AI-aided Drug Discovery


### Project Description



AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD) is gaining increasing popularity due to its promise of  making  the  search  for  new   pharmaceuticals  quicker,  cheaper  and  more  efficient.  Inspite of its extensive use in many fields,  such as ADMET prediction,  virtual screening, protein folding and generative chemistry, little has been explored in terms of the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem with _noise_, which is inevitable in real world AIDD applications.


In this work, we present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark for AI-aided drug discovery,  which comes with an open-source Python package that fully automates the data curation and OOD benchmarking processes.  We focus on one of the most crucial problems in AIDD: drug target binding affinity prediction, which involves both macromolecule (protein target) and small-molecule (drug compound).  In contrast to only providing fixed datasets, DrugOOD offers automated dataset curator with user-friendly customization scripts, rich domain annotations aligned with biochemistry knowledge,  realistic  noise  annotations  and  rigorous  benchmarking  of  state-of-the-art OOD algorithms.  Since the molecular data is often modeled as irregular graphs using graph neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD also serves as a valuable testbed for _graph OOD learning_ problems.  Extensive empirical studies have shown a significant performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution experiments, which highlights the need to develop better schemes that can allow for OOD generalization under noise for AIDD.
