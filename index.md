## DrugOOD: OOD Dataset Curator and Benchmark for AI Aided Drug Discovery


### Project Description

AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD) is gaining increasingly more popularity due to its promise  of making the hunt for new pharmaceuticals quicker, cheaper and more effective. Though being extensively applied in various areas, such as ADMET prediction, virtual screening,  protein folding  and generative chemistry, little has been explored in terms of the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem with `noise`, which is inevitable in real world AIDD applications.


In this work, we present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark for AI-aided drug discovery,  which comes with an open-source Python package that fully automates the data curation and OOD benchmarking processes.  We focus on one of the most crucial problems in AIDD: drug target binding affinity prediction, which involves both macro-molecule (protein target) and small-molecule (drug compound). In contrast to only providing fixed datasets,  DrugOOD offers automated dataset curator with user-friendly customization scripts,  rich domain annotations aligned with bio-chemistry knowledge, realistic noise annotations and rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms. Since the molecular data is often modeled as irregular graphs using graph neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD also serves as an important testbed for `graph OOD learning` problems.  From extensive empirical studies, we  observe significant performance gap between  in-distribution and out-of-distribution experiments, which calls for attention for developing better schemes that allow for OOD generalization for AI-aided drug discovery.
